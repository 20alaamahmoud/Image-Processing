- Geometry Operatios : (Direct Mapping Resize : 0-Order, 1-Order), (Reverse Mapping : 0-Order, 1-Order).
- Pixel Operations : Convert to Grayscale [Single color channel, Average gray, Luminance, Desaturation, Decomposing],
                     Draw Histogram, Brightness, DarkBright, Contrast, Power-Law Transformations (Gamma correction), Histogram Equalization,
                     Histogram Matching, Image Algebra (Add, Subtract), Image Negative, Quantization.
- Neighborhood Operations : 1) Smoothing Linear Filters : Mean(Averaging) filter, Weighted (Gaussian) filter.
                            2) Smoothing Non-Linear Filters : Median filter, Min filter, Max filter.
                               Edge Detection filter, Sharpening, Unsharpening Mask.
- Image Restoration : Salt & Pepper Noise.
- Frequency Filters : 1) Lowpass Filtering : Ideal lowpass filter, Butterworth lowpass filter, Gaussian lowpass filter.
                      2) Highpass Filtering : Ideal highpass filter, Butterworth highpass filter, Gaussian highpass filter.
- Morphological Operations : Dilation, Erosion, Opening, Closing.
