# Image-Processing
Image Processing filters, using MATLAB
- Geometry Operatios : (Direct Mapping Resize : 0-Order, 1-Order), (Reverse Mapping : 0-Order, 1-Order).
- Pixel Operations : Convert to Grayscale [Single color channel, Average gray, Luminance, Desaturation, Decomposing],
                     Draw Histogram, Brightness, DarkBright, Contrast, Power-Law Transformations (Gamma correction), Histogram Equalization,
                     Histogram Matching, Image Algebra (Add, Subtract), Image Negative, Quantization.
- Neighborhood Operations : - Smoothing Linear Filters : Mean(Averaging) filter, Weighted (Gaussian) filter.
                            - Smoothing Non-Linear Filters : Median filter, Min filter, Max filter.
                               Edge Detection filter, Sharpening, Unsharpening Mask
- Image Restoration : Salt & Pepper Noise
- Frequency Filters : - Lowpass Filtering : Ideal lowpass filter, Butterworth lowpass filter, Gaussian lowpass filter
                      - Highpass Filtering : Ideal highpass filter, Butterworth highpass filter, Gaussian highpass filter
- Morphological Operations : Dilation, Erosion, Opening, Closing
